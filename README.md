# Vocabulary Richness Calculator

This Python script calculates and compares the vocabulary richness of two text files. It can be used to determine which text has a richer vocabulary based on the ratio of unique words to the total number of words.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install NLTK using pip:
```bash
pip install nltk
Usage
Place the text files you want to analyze in the same directory as this script.


## Run the script by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python vocabulary_richness.py
The script will calculate the vocabulary richness for each text and print a comparison message indicating which text has a richer vocabulary.
Customization


Feel free to adjust the lemmatization or tokenization methods to suit your specific requirements.

Example
Suppose you have two text files, "dorian.txt" and "jekyll.txt," containing the text of "The Portrait of Dorian Gray" and "The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde," respectively. Running this script will tell you which book has a richer vocabulary.
